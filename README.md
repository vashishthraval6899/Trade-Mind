📈 Trade-Mind: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Financial Intelligence System

Trade-Mind is a production-oriented Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates institutional-grade market analysis. The system models financial reasoning by orchestrating structured debates between “Bull” and “Bear” AI agents, followed by a neutral “Judge” agent that synthesizes both perspectives into a balanced, actionable market insight.

🛠 Technical Architecture & Core Contributions

I designed and engineered the complete end-to-end backend architecture with a focus on scalability, contextual grounding, and reasoning robustness.

📦 Financial Data Ingestion & Processing

Built structured pipelines to ingest, clean, and preprocess unstructured financial documents.

Implemented BGE embedding models for high-fidelity semantic representation.

Designed preprocessing workflows to improve downstream retrieval precision.

🔍 High-Performance Retrieval System

Developed a vector-based storage and retrieval pipeline to enable domain-aware contextual reasoning.

Optimized similarity search to ensure the LLM receives relevant, query-specific financial evidence.

Reduced hallucinations by grounding all reasoning in retrieved documents.

🤖 Multi-Agent Debate Framework

Bull Agent: Extracts growth catalysts and upside opportunities.

Bear Agent: Identifies risks, macro headwinds, and downside factors.

Judge Agent: Uses LLM-based reasoning to evaluate both perspectives and generate structured, balanced trade insights.

This architecture enhances explainability and reduces single-prompt bias.

⚡ Optimized LLM Inference Layer

Integrated Mistral and Llama models for contextual reasoning over retrieved financial evidence.

Structured outputs for downstream reporting, analytics dashboards, and decision support systems.

Designed modular inference pipelines for model flexibility and scalability.

🌟 Key Differentiators & Value
✔ Production-Grade AI Architecture

Demonstrates expertise beyond model training — full lifecycle AI system design from ingestion → embedding → retrieval → reasoning → structured output.

✔ Bias Mitigation via Multi-Agent Reasoning

Implements a debate-style architecture to minimize hallucination risk and single-model bias.

✔ Scalable RAG Engineering

Builds modular, extensible infrastructure suitable for real-world financial intelligence applications.
