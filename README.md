Trade-Mind is an AI-powered financial intelligence system that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models to perform Bullish, Bearish, and Judge-based market analysis.

I designed and built the complete backend architecture including:

Financial data ingestion

Embedding generation using BGE models

Vector storage and retrieval pipeline

Multi-agent reasoning (Bull, Bear, Judge framework)

LLM inference using Mistral / Llama models

The system retrieves relevant contextual financial documents from a vector database and combines them with LLM reasoning to generate structured trading insights.

Trade-Mind demonstrates my ability to design scalable AI systems, implement RAG pipelines, and build production-level ML architectures beyond simple model training.
